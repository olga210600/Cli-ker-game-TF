        <p>
            Many years ago, people in the Tungwali settlement lived in peace and harmony, farming and other crafts. The
            tribe was ruled for many years by Chief Bari. He was a wise and just chief, and during his reign the people
            became united and began to learn new trades. The chief had two sons, the elder Duran and the younger Aaron.
            Duran was an excellent hunter, and Aaron helped his father in everything; he spent much time with the people
            of their settlement and helped them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many years passed by, the old Bari felt his imminent death, and decided to hand over the reign to his
            youngest son, for he saw in him a good leader who would take care of his people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shortly thereafter Bari died, and when he learned of his father's decision, the eldest son rebelled and
            decided to kill his younger brother Aaron by force to take power.
